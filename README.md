<h1>KGE Technologies Assignment 2</h1>

<p>My 2nd assignment was to build the Company's Internship Apply page.</p>

<p>
I was tasked to design and develop internship apply page which the company wanted to change from Zoho forms to their own. The Internship apply page was a multistep form containing different fields for each form in each step. There are two buttons (back and next) to move from one form to another.

<h2>About KGE Technologies</h2> 

<p>From January 04, 2023 to March 04, 2023, I worked as a Web Developer Intern at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kge-technologies/" target="_blank">KGE Technologies Pvt Ltd</a> for a duration of two months. This internship provided me with the chance to use the knowledge I gained in the classroom to create real-world projects. Throughout the course of the internship, I developed an extensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and honed my skills in designing responsive websites.</p>
